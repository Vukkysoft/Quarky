    <h1>Contributing to Quarky</h1>
    <p>Fancy frameworks are too scawy for me, so these instructions shouldn't be too advanced. You might still want to look at it if you're uncertain, though.</p>
    <h2 id="editor">Editor</h2>
    <p>Personally I use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a>, but it's expensive... <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> should work as an alternative in this case.</p>
    <h2 id="getcode">Getting the code</h2>
    <small><p>※ A GitHub account is required to contribute to Quarky. If you don't have one, go to <a href="https://github.com/signup">https://github.com/signup</a>.</p></small>
    <p>If you're planning to contribute to Quarky, you'll want to <a href="https://github.com/vukkysoft/quarky/fork">fork the GitHub repository</a>, then install <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> if you don't already have them.</p>
    <p>Then open a terminal, go to your desired folder, and run these commands (<b>replace YOURUSER with your GitHub username</b>):</p>
    <pre class="terminal">git clone https://github.com/YOURUSER/quarky<br>cd quarky<br>npm i && npm run build</pre>
    <h2 id="branch">Creating a branch</h2>
    <p>If you already know what you're going to contribute, you should create a branch. This allows you to keep your changes separate from the main Quarky code, and other changes - which is especially helpful if you're juggling multiple changes that haven't been merged into Quarky yet.</p>
    <pre class="terminal">git checkout -b BRANCHNAME main</pre>
    <small><p>※ Your branch name should be a short description of what you're changing, like <code>fix-settings-typo</code>.</p></small>
    <h2 id="liveserver">Editing the code</h2>
    <p>The <code class="terminal">git clone</code> command from earlier should have created a <code>quarky</code> folder in your desired folder. Open it in your editor.</p>
    <p>Once you have done that, if you're using Visual Studio Code, you should open the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>), type <code>Show Recommended Extensions</code>, and install the extensions that appear.</p>
    <p>Now you can start editing the code! To open Quarky in your web browser, press the Start button next to "Start local Quarky" in WebStorm, or the Go Live button in the bottom right of Visual Studio Code.</p>
    <h2 id="pr">I made my changes, now what?</h2>
    <small><p>※ When using <code class="terminal">git commit</code>, you should provide a short message that explains what you changed. "Made changes" isn't very helpful, so you'll probably want to type something else. Make sure to keep the quotation marks.</p></small>
    <pre class="terminal">git add .<br>git commit -m "Made changes"<br>git push</pre>
    <p>Then, go to <a href="https://github.com/Vukkysoft/Quarky">https://github.com/Vukkysoft/Quarky</a>. A box should appear with your GitHub username and branch name, saying that there were recent pushes on it.  Click the "Compare & pull request" button to request your changes to be merged into Quarky.</p>
