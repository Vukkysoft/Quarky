    <h2>OwO, what's this? *notices your docs*</h2>
    <p>This is the documentation folder of Quarky. Sometimes a user guide, sometimes developer instructions, sometimes a trivia section, sometimes offering a bit of insight, but mostly a distraction from actually working on the software - it's text!</p>
    <h2>Neat. What can I read?</h2>
    <p>Nothing!</p>
