It's a Lightquark client. A terrible one, but it has some personality, or so I've been told. You can use it at https://quarky.vukky.net.

## Features
- Joining quarks
- Reading messages
- Sending messages (including /me, /shrug, and \*purrs\* stowen uwuspeak fow chwonicawwy onwine Wightquawk usews... oh nyo :3)
- You don't get to edit them though
- And the client doesn't adapt well to screen resolutions other than my own

### Features that'll show up when I stop procrastinating
You can see those here: https://litdevs.youtrack.cloud/issues?q=project:%20%7BQuarky%7D%20State:%20Unresolved

Or throw even more at me, but no promises I'll do it: https://litdevs.youtrack.cloud/newIssue?project=QUARKY
