It's a Lightquark client. Not a very good one, but it has some personality, or so I've been told. You can use it at https://quarky.vukky.net.

## Features
- Joining quarks
- Reading messages
- Sending messages (including /me, /shrug, and \*purrs\* uwuspeak fow chwonicawwy onwine Wightquawk usews :P)
- You don't get to delete them though

### Features that'll show up when I stop procrastinating
I'll never manage to maintain such a list if it was in the README, so you can have this GitHub projects link: https://github.com/users/Vukkyy/projects/2/views/2
